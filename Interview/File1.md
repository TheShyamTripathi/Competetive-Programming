### Frequently Asked Questions

**Q. What does a logic programming language show?**
A logic programming language shows the following features:
Declarative approach: Logic programming languages use a declarative approach to programming, which means that the programmer specifies what the program should do, rather than how it should do it.
Facts and rules: Programs in logic programming languages consist of facts and rules. Facts are statements about the problem domain, while rules are inferences about the facts.
Logical clauses: Rules are written as logical clauses with a head and a body. The head specifies the conclusion, while the body specifies the conditions under which the conclusion is true.

**Q. Define backend development.**
Web development that focuses on the server side of web applications is known as back-end development. It includes creating and maintaining the databases, APIs, server-side logic, and other elements that go into a website or application's backend. The backend of a program, including data storage, security, and server-side operations, is the responsibility of backend developers. Programmers use languages like Python, Ruby, Java, and PHP to produce clear, manageable code that permits communication between the front-end and back-end of the application.

**Q. What is the software development lifecycle?**
High-quality software is designed, developed, tested, and maintained using a process known as the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC). Every stage of the software development process has distinct deliverables, and the SDLC offers a methodical management structure.

**Q. What are version control systems?**
Software technology known as a version control system (VCS) aids in managing source code changes made over time by software development teams. It is a part of software configuration management and goes by the names of source control, revision control, and source code management.

**Q. Mention some advantages of assembly language.**
Some advantages of assembly language are:

-Speed and control: Assembly language is quicker and more effective than other programming languages because it offers direct access to the computer's hardware.
-Low-level access: Assembly language grants access to a computer's internal workings, enabling the optimization and fine-tuning of certain activities.
-Smaller code size: Code written in assembly language is shorter and easier to manage and maintain than code written in higher-level programming languages.
-Greater security: Assembly language can be used to create more secure software, as it allows for fine-grained control over memory and other system resources.

**Q. What is a binary language?**
Only two symbols, usually the numbers 0 and 1, are used in binary languages to represent data. It serves as the foundation for all binary code utilized in computing systems. Computers interpret user input and operational instructions using binary language, which they then employ to offer the user accurate results. Each decimal number is represented in binary by a group of four binary digits or bits.
